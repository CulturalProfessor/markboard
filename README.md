> TO BE DONE

## Development

Development requirements:

- MongoDB with replica set ([distributed transactions required](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/transactions/))
- Redis (distributed lock required)

You can build a local MongoDB replica set easily reference [this](https://gist.github.com/oleurud/d9629ef197d8dab682f9035f4bb29065)

Use `yarn` to install dependencies.

Start development server with `yarn dev`

###### Notes

- We shouldn't name a DTO type with `dto` only. [Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) may be useful but ignored semantic of a variable or a type. For example, if we name the parameter of create model API and methods as `CreateModelDTO` we cannot determine the usage scenario of this variable or type (is it a temporary type, a parameter type or a return type?). So we should specified the scene type of it like `CreateModelParam`. But we don't need the hungarian notation when the usage scenario is clear.
- MongoDB don't support WLock in transactions when create new document so we should use Redis as lock to ensure the concurrency.
- During testing we'll start a replica set in memory MongoDB. But you can specify the environment variable `MONGO_URL` to use external MongoDB clusters to speed up testing.
- We don't against leave TODO in comment but encourage leave a TODO if you have a better idea but canâ€™t implement it in the short term. It maybe avoid an idea or a plan being forgotten.
