# Code Of Conduct

1. Make sure that all of your application code should be placed inside the `imports/` directory. See [Meteor - File structure](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html#javascript-structure)
  ]

2. Use absolute imports e.g. `import { App } from '/imports/ui/App'` instead of relative imports `../../../imports/ui/App` when you need to import files across hierarchies
